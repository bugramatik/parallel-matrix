# Multithreaded Matrix Multiplication
This repository contains the implementation of a multithreaded matrix multiplication program for the CENG334 Operating Systems course. It uses pthreads in C++ to calculate the multiplication of matrices in a concurrent manner.

## Quickstart
1. Compile the program with ```make all```.
2. Run the program with an input file, e.g. ```./hw2 < input1.txt```.
3. Test the program with all provided inputs using ```make test```.
4. Clean up with ```make clean```.
This project uses pthreads in C++ for concurrent matrix multiplication.
